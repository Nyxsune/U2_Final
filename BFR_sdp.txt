I really only need two loops, one to go through the animals and move them and a nested one inside that to go through the other animals and if an animal is on the space it moved to, then do any collisions that need to happed with if else statements
place baby and animal death either add or remove an animal from population and animals. For place baby it would likely just be add one to population and add the new animal object to animals. While for animal death it would likely just be minus one from population and delete the dead animal from animals using it's coords to easily figure out where it is.
River.animal_death() and Animal.death() are connected by Animal.death() simply calls River.animal_death() and sends the animal object. They are all connected because Animal.collision(), if it's a beer colliding with a fish, calls Beer.consume(), which then calls Animal.death(), which then calls River.animal_death()
Beer.starve() is called if the beer does not eat that day, determined by the Beer.eaten_today flag, and minuses one from Beer.lives, which starts at Beer.max_lives. If Beer.consume() is called, then none of the other shenanigans happen.
The two changes that should happen is the previous space is reverted to a water space and the new space is where the animal is moved. When two animals collide, the river should not be redrawn. I will likely do the redrawing at the very end of the day when everything has moved.
